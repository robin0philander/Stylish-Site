        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>I always believed that i had a creative mind.
          So doing digital design work like web and graphic designing has been a passion of mine for a while now.
          I've gained some experience over the years designing concept websites, as well as designing logo's, posters and a variety of cards etc
          for myself and for those who needed my services.

        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>Since the day i left high school i've been fascinated in developing my own apps and potential video games.
          That's why i chose to study IT-Software Development & Computer Science at College and Varsity.
          I've ganied some experience in the app development process, when i created my first mobile game called "Fly Barry, Fly" and published it to the android PlayStore. </p>
